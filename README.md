# ChipCheck Access Control

## Project Description

"ChipCheck Access Control" is a project aimed at creating an access control system using Arduino and electronic cards or chips for user identification. The system enables secure and convenient access to specific areas or resources.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository to your computer.
2. Connect Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Open the `ChipCheck_Access_Control.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
4. Upload the sketch to your Arduino.

## Getting Started

1. Connect the card reader to Arduino according to the wiring diagram.
2. Connect electronic cards or chips that will be used for user identification.
3. Upload the list of authorized users to Arduino (this can be done through Arduino code or an external interface).
4. Power on Arduino.

## Inputs

- Card reader for electronic cards or chips.
- Arduino ports for connecting the reader and other devices.

## Outputs

- Access control mechanism (e.g., electromagnetic lock or relay to control the lock).
- Status indicators (e.g., LEDs) to indicate access status (allowed/denied).

## Example Usage

1. A user presents their electronic card to the card reader.
2. Arduino analyzes the information from the card and compares it with the database of authorized users.
3. Upon a match, Arduino grants access and controls the door-opening mechanism.
4. The user enters the premises.
